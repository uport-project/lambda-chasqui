## API Description

### Topics and Subscriptions
Chasqui can be used to send information from one point to another, this is done through _topics_. The recepient sets a new topic on chasqui, communicate the topic to the sender and suscribe to the _topic_. The sender can send data (json objects) to the _topic_ and chasqui will relay the data to the suscribers of that _topic_.

In uPort this is used to send the uPortId from the mobile app to the dApp (running in a browser). This flow is known as [uPort Connect](UPORT.md#Connect). It is also used for requesting transaction signing when no two-way communication between the dApp and the mobile app is set. This flow is known as [uPort Sign](UPORT.md#Sign)
